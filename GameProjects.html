									</header>
									<a href="https://seanb33.itch.io/3d-escape-room" class="image fit"><img src="images/EscapeRoom.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This 3D game replicates the challenge of real-life escape rooms, making the experience accessible from home. 
										It is a first-person, single-player game with a time challenge set in an Egyptian tomb. You must complete three 
										unique rooms, each with its own design and puzzles, including physics-based ones. The game features an inventory 
										system, interactive objects, splash screens, a start menu, in-game menus, sound effects, cinematics, and a 
										cohesive visual style. Available as a Windows executable on itch.io. Please ensure your PC meets the necessary 
										requirements to run this full-fledged 3D game smoothly.</p>

									<p>Relaxing River is a simple and relaxing game mobile game for players to enjoy. I created every aspect of it myself (besides the music) 
										using Godot Game Engine and MS Paint 3D. The gameplay consists of the player controlling a kayak moving down a river while avoiding 
										obstacles and collecting berries. It is 2D top down pixel art single player game with a high score system. The game is available on 
										Google Play throught the link below.

									<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.duel" class="image fit"><img src="images/Duel.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Duel is a game I made in my free time during a spring break. It took about a week to create from start to finish. It is based on a road trip game I played with friends 
										as a kid. In the game, you duel with an AI opponent and have to make decisions like Load, Dodge, or Shoot while managing your own ammunition (It helps to keep track of their ammunition
										as well by the way). The game, besides a few artistic assets such as the music, was made solely by me and is available on Google Play.

									<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.hydrainvaders" class="image fit"><img src="images/HydraInvaders.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Hydra Invaders was my first real step into making a game with a game engine on my own. It is a cross between the concept of the Hydra (cut one head off and two 
										grow back) and the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. In addition, I added some of my own touches such as ship selection, a shield, and a nuke. It was created 
										solely by myself, besides a few artistic assets, and is available on Google Play.

									<a href="https://seanb33.itch.io/color-dungeon" class="image fit"><img src="images/ColorDungeon.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Color Dungeon was created as the final project in a game development class I took. I was in a group with two other students; we came up with the concept and made the game together.
										This game was made as a team and our tasks were never clearly divvied up. We all had input and contributions to the entire game. However, in general, I worked mostly on player 
										movement, the health systems, the final boss, and refinement of all the mechanics in general such as shooting. Color Dungeon is available for play on itch.io.

									<p>Cure of the Undead is a hyperlink story-based game, akin to Choose Your Own Adventure novels, that I created as a part of a game development class I took. The focus of this assignment
										was to understand branching narratives and pacing. The storyline(s) as well as the rest of the game was created solely by myself and is available to play on itch.io.
