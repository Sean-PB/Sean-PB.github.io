									<p>Duel is a game I made in my free time during spring break. It took about a week to create from start to finish. It is based on a road trip game I played with friends 
										as a kid. In the game you duel with an AI opponent and have to make decisions like Load, Dodge, or Shoot while managing your own ammunition (It helps to keep track of their ammunition
										as well by the way). The game, besides a few artistic assets such as the music, was made soley by me and is available on Google Play.</p>

									<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.hydrainvaders" class="image fit"><img src="images/HydraInvaders.JPG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Hydra Invaders was my first real step into making a game with a game engine on my own. It is a cross between the concept of the Hydra (cut one head off and two 
										grow back) and the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. In addition, I added some of my own touches such as ship selection, a shield, and a nuke. It was created 
										soley by myself, besides a few artistic assets, and is available on Google Play.</p>

									<p>Color Dungeon was created as the final project in a game development class I took. Myself and two others were in a group and we came up with the concept and made the game together.
										This game was made as a team and our tasks were never clearly divied up. We all had input and contributions to the entire game. However, in general I worked mostly on player 
										movement, the health systems, the final boss, and refinement of all the mechanics in general such as shooting. Color Dungeon is available for play on itch.io.

									<p>Cure of the Undead is a hyperlink story based game, akin to Choose Your Own Adventure novels, that I created as a part of a game development class I took. The focus of this assignment
										was to understand branching narratives and pacing. The story line(s) as well as the rest of the game was created soley by myself and is available to play on itch.io.

									<p>Relaxing River is a game that I am currently developing. The goal for it is to be a procedurally generated river that occasionally splits so there is some player choice. On the
										banks of the river are trees which when passed will have a chance of a bird flying out of them and dropping an item such as berries in the water which when the player taps on will
										make the character do a happy animation. There is also a character creator menu that allows one to change the skin and hair color of the character. Like I said before, it is still 
										in progress however I am excited to continue work on it and see it through to the end!
